  "description" : "It is a behavioral project standard that represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object's structure. The visitor allows the creation of a new operation without changing the class of the elements in which it operates. It is a way of separating an algorithm from the object's structure. A practical result is the ability to add new functionalities to the structures of a pre-existing object without having to modify them. ",
