Tech Radar is like a portfolio to visualize the technologies and methodologies that an institution uses and trusts, monitor new trends and also identify which tools can be discontinued. Your goal is to keep teams strategically updated.\nHow it works? Radar has four quadrants, with their respective categories: languages and frameworks, platforms, techniques and services. In each of the quadrants there are four rings, where the level of importance and relevance of the technology and/or methodology is identified. Our rings are named Strategic, Essential, Potential and Discontinued. The closer the technology is to the center of the radar, the more important it is.\nFor example, to choose a tool, language or methodology, we will prioritize the one that the team already knows or masters. In some cases, it is important to check if there is any study regarding this new demand. If two teams need to know a tool, all engineering will know that there is a new front with this objective, thanks to Radar.\nTech Radar within teams Within the open source team at Zup, we use Tech Radar for knowledge management and also to help us make a quality solution.\nDiscover our main motivations:\nManage the information that circulates between different teams: knowing the tools each team uses or wants to use makes it easier to establish effective communication between projects and also avoid knowledge silos.\nMotivate and train: once the technologies that teams need to learn and/or improve are mapped, it is possible to organize study groups, lectures, workshops and research, including cross-times.\nAvoid losing focus and the “herd effect”: even though there is plenty of opportunity to learn about new tools in external events, it is important to pay attention to the real motivations behind the pile used, as they will certainly have tools that “scale”, \" perform”, etc. Care must be taken not to turn the projects into a “laboratory in production”.\nPrevent the technology stack from becoming a “fruit salad”: very similar to the previous case and, sometimes, derived from it, the big point is to avoid having several tools that do the same thing. After all, if within the group there is already a solution that solves a problem, what is the motivation to use a new one for the same purpose?\nCode quality: a focused team with high cohesion in the technology stack facilitates knowledge management, resulting in good practices and fluency between teams, as well as better written and worked codes.\nBeing truly open source: one of the critical points in these types of projects is that they really need to be open source, that is, that their dependencies have licenses compatible with our projects.\nOur rings Strategic: everything considered fundamental to the projects. The teams have knowledge, security and fluency.\nEssential: everything that is already in the process of adoption, knowledge is vital to the team’s success. Therefore, teams need training and/or experience.\nPotential: everything that adheres to the culture, the necessary licenses and has the potential to be adopted in current projects or in future engagements. For this, it is interesting to carry out studies and tests to validate the effectiveness in the respective application scenario.\nDiscontinued: anything that is currently used but must be removed. The reasons for such a measure are due to the cohesion of the technological stack or the break in culture and/or open source licenses adopted.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"What is Radar?

Originally written and deployed at Lyft, Envoy now has a vibrant contributor base and is an official Cloud Native Computing Foundation project.\nWhy ? As on the ground microservice practitioners quickly realize, the majority of operational problems that arise when moving to a distributed architecture are ultimately grounded in two areas: networking and observability. It is simply an orders of magnitude larger problem to network and debug a set of intertwined distributed services versus a single monolithic application.\nOriginally built at Lyft, Envoy is a high performance C++ distributed proxy designed for single services and applications, as well as a communication bus and “universal data plane” designed for large microservice “service mesh” architectures. Built on the learnings of solutions such as NGINX, HAProxy, hardware load balancers, and cloud load balancers, Envoy runs alongside every application and abstracts the network by providing common features in a platform-agnostic manner.

This approach is different from normal software testing, where they generate the code first and only then test it.\nTDD developers use test cases before they write a single line of code. This approach encourages them to consider how the software will be used and what design it needs to have to provide the expected usability.

Tech Radar is like a portfolio to visualize the technologies and methodologies that an institution uses and trusts, monitor new trends and also identify which tools can be discontinued. Your goal is to keep teams strategically updated.\nHow it works? Radar has four quadrants, with their respective categories: languages and frameworks, platforms, techniques and services. In each of the quadrants there are four rings, where the level of importance and relevance of the technology and/or methodology is identified. Our rings are named Strategic, Essential, Potential and Discontinued. The closer the technology is to the center of the radar, the more important it is.\nFor example, to choose a tool, language or methodology, we will prioritize the one that the team already knows or masters. In some cases, it is important to check if there is any study regarding this new demand. If two teams need to know a tool, all engineering will know that there is a new front with this objective, thanks to Radar.\nTech Radar within teams Within the open source team at Zup, we use Tech Radar for knowledge management and also to help us make a quality solution.\nDiscover our main motivations:\nManage the information that circulates between different teams: knowing the tools each team uses or wants to use makes it easier to establish effective communication between projects and also avoid knowledge silos.\nMotivate and train: once the technologies that teams need to learn and/or improve are mapped, it is possible to organize study groups, lectures, workshops and research, including cross-times.\nAvoid losing focus and the “herd effect”: even though there is plenty of opportunity to learn about new tools in external events, it is important to pay attention to the real motivations behind the pile used, as they will certainly have tools that “scale”, \" perform”, etc. Care must be taken not to turn the projects into a “laboratory in production”.\nPrevent the technology stack from becoming a “fruit salad”: very similar to the previous case and, sometimes, derived from it, the big point is to avoid having several tools that do the same thing. After all, if within the group there is already a solution that solves a problem, what is the motivation to use a new one for the same purpose?\nCode quality: a focused team with high cohesion in the technology stack facilitates knowledge management, resulting in good practices and fluency between teams, as well as better written and worked codes.\nBeing truly open source: one of the critical points in these types of projects is that they really need to be open source, that is, that their dependencies have licenses compatible with our projects.\nOur rings Strategic: everything considered fundamental to the projects. The teams have knowledge, security and fluency.\nEssential: everything that is already in the process of adoption, knowledge is vital to the team’s success. Therefore, teams need training and/or experience.\nPotential: everything that adheres to the culture, the necessary licenses and has the potential to be adopted in current projects or in future engagements. For this, it is interesting to carry out studies and tests to validate the effectiveness in the respective application scenario.\nDiscontinued: anything that is currently used but must be removed. The reasons for such a measure are due to the cohesion of the technological stack or the break in culture and/or open source licenses adopted.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"What is Radar?

TDD promotes a test-then-code approach. It’s based on the idea that if developers use test cases before writing functionality, they can create better software and, often, complete the project faster. This approach is different from normal software testing, where they generate the code first and only then test it.\nTDD developers use test cases before they write a single line of code. This approach encourages them to consider how the software will be used and what design it needs to have to provide the expected usability.

Tech Radar is like a portfolio to visualize the technologies and methodologies that an institution uses and trusts, monitor new trends and also identify which tools can be discontinued. Your goal is to keep teams strategically updated.\nHow it works? Radar has four quadrants, with their respective categories: languages and frameworks, platforms, techniques and services. In each of the quadrants there are four rings, where the level of importance and relevance of the technology and/or methodology is identified. Our rings are named Strategic, Essential, Potential and Discontinued. The closer the technology is to the center of the radar, the more important it is.\nFor example, to choose a tool, language or methodology, we will prioritize the one that the team already knows or masters. In some cases, it is important to check if there is any study regarding this new demand. If two teams need to know a tool, all engineering will know that there is a new front with this objective, thanks to Radar.\nTech Radar within teams Within the open source team at Zup, we use Tech Radar for knowledge management and also to help us make a quality solution.\nDiscover our main motivations:\nManage the information that circulates between different teams: knowing the tools each team uses or wants to use makes it easier to establish effective communication between projects and also avoid knowledge silos.\nMotivate and train: once the technologies that teams need to learn and/or improve are mapped, it is possible to organize study groups, lectures, workshops and research, including cross-times.\nAvoid losing focus and the “herd effect”: even though there is plenty of opportunity to learn about new tools in external events, it is important to pay attention to the real motivations behind the pile used, as they will certainly have tools that “scale”, \" perform”, etc. Care must be taken not to turn the projects into a “laboratory in production”.\nPrevent the technology stack from becoming a “fruit salad”: very similar to the previous case and, sometimes, derived from it, the big point is to avoid having several tools that do the same thing. After all, if within the group there is already a solution that solves a problem, what is the motivation to use a new one for the same purpose?\nCode quality: a focused team with high cohesion in the technology stack facilitates knowledge management, resulting in good practices and fluency between teams, as well as better written and worked codes.\nBeing truly open source: one of the critical points in these types of projects is that they really need to be open source, that is, that their dependencies have licenses compatible with our projects.\nOur rings Strategic: everything considered fundamental to the projects. The teams have knowledge, security and fluency.\nEssential: everything that is already in the process of adoption, knowledge is vital to the team’s success. Therefore, teams need training and/or experience.\nPotential: everything that adheres to the culture, the necessary licenses and has the potential to be adopted in current projects or in future engagements. For this, it is interesting to carry out studies and tests to validate the effectiveness in the respective application scenario.\nDiscontinued: anything that is currently used but must be removed. The reasons for such a measure are due to the cohesion of the technological stack or the break in culture and/or open source licenses adopted.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"What is Radar?

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the software is improved to pass the new tests, only.\nWhy ? TDD promotes a test-then-code approach. It’s based on the idea that if developers use test cases before writing functionality, they can create better software and, often, complete the project faster. This approach is different from normal software testing, where they generate the code first and only then test it.\nTDD developers use test cases before they write a single line of code. This approach encourages them to consider how the software will be used and what design it needs to have to provide the expected usability.

Tech Radar is like a portfolio to visualize the technologies and methodologies that an institution uses and trusts, monitor new trends and also identify which tools can be discontinued. Your goal is to keep teams strategically updated.\nHow it works? Radar has four quadrants, with their respective categories: languages and frameworks, platforms, techniques and services. In each of the quadrants there are four rings, where the level of importance and relevance of the technology and/or methodology is identified. Our rings are named Strategic, Essential, Potential and Discontinued. The closer the technology is to the center of the radar, the more important it is.\nFor example, to choose a tool, language or methodology, we will prioritize the one that the team already knows or masters. In some cases, it is important to check if there is any study regarding this new demand. If two teams need to know a tool, all engineering will know that there is a new front with this objective, thanks to Radar.\nTech Radar within teams Within the open source team at Zup, we use Tech Radar for knowledge management and also to help us make a quality solution.\nDiscover our main motivations:\nManage the information that circulates between different teams: knowing the tools each team uses or wants to use makes it easier to establish effective communication between projects and also avoid knowledge silos.\nMotivate and train: once the technologies that teams need to learn and/or improve are mapped, it is possible to organize study groups, lectures, workshops and research, including cross-times.\nAvoid losing focus and the “herd effect”: even though there is plenty of opportunity to learn about new tools in external events, it is important to pay attention to the real motivations behind the pile used, as they will certainly have tools that “scale”, \" perform”, etc. Care must be taken not to turn the projects into a “laboratory in production”.\nPrevent the technology stack from becoming a “fruit salad”: very similar to the previous case and, sometimes, derived from it, the big point is to avoid having several tools that do the same thing. After all, if within the group there is already a solution that solves a problem, what is the motivation to use a new one for the same purpose?\nCode quality: a focused team with high cohesion in the technology stack facilitates knowledge management, resulting in good practices and fluency between teams, as well as better written and worked codes.\nBeing truly open source: one of the critical points in these types of projects is that they really need to be open source, that is, that their dependencies have licenses compatible with our projects.\nOur rings Strategic: everything considered fundamental to the projects. The teams have knowledge, security and fluency.\nEssential: everything that is already in the process of adoption, knowledge is vital to the team’s success. Therefore, teams need training and/or experience.\nPotential: everything that adheres to the culture, the necessary licenses and has the potential to be adopted in current projects or in future engagements. For this, it is interesting to carry out studies and tests to validate the effectiveness in the respective application scenario.\nDiscontinued: anything that is currently used but must be removed. The reasons for such a measure are due to the cohesion of the technological stack or the break in culture and/or open source licenses adopted.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"What is Radar?

Once a test fails, developers understand what needs to be changed and they refactor the code, that is, they rewrite it to improve it without altering its function.\nFor who ?
