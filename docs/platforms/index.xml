      <description>What is it ? Envoy Proxy is a modern, high performance, small footprint edge and service proxy. Envoy is most comparable to software load balancers such as NGINX and HAProxy. Originally written and deployed at Lyft, Envoy now has a vibrant contributor base and is an official Cloud Native Computing Foundation project.
Why ? As on the ground microservice practitioners quickly realize, the majority of operational problems that arise when moving to a distributed architecture are ultimately grounded in two areas: networking and observability.</description>

      <guid>https://zupit.github.io/opensource-tech-radar/platforms/vcluster/</guid>
      <description>What is it ? Virtual clusters have their own API server which makes them much more powerful and better isolated than namespaces, but they are also much cheaper than creating separate &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; Kubernetes clusters.
Why ? Virtual clusters solve many of the problems that namespaces present, such as:
 Cluster-Scoped Resources: Certain resources live globally in the cluster, and you canâ€™t isolate them using namespaces. For example, installing istio or any other operator in different versions is not possible within a single cluster.</description>
