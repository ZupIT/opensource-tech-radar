      <description>What is it ? Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Go is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency.
Why ? It is tested and proved that applications that are written on Go are highly performant and scalable. Golang is a very efficient language, just like C/C++, handling parallelisms like Java, and has easy code readability like Python and pearl.</description>

      <description>What is it ? RabbitMQ is an open-source message-broker software that originally implemented the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol and has since been extended with a plug-in architecture to support Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol, MQ Telemetry Transport, and other protocols.
Why ? RabbitMQ is therefore ideal for long-running tasks or blocking tasks, allowing web servers to respond quickly to requests instead of being forced to perform computationally intensive tasks on the spot.</description>

      <description>What is it ? Redis is an in-memory data structure store, used as a distributed, in-memory key–value database, cache and message broker, with optional durability. Redis supports different kinds of abstract data structures, such as strings, lists, maps, sets, sorted sets, HyperLogLogs, bitmaps, streams, and spatial indices.
Why ? Redis simplifies your code by enabling you to write fewer lines of code to store, access, and use data in your applications.</description>

      <guid>https://zupit.github.io/opensource-tech-radar/pt-br/categories/platforms/swagger/</guid>
      <description>What is it ? Swagger is an Interface Description Language for describing RESTful APIs expressed using JSON. Swagger is used together with a set of open-source software tools to design, build, document, and use RESTful web services. Swagger includes automated documentation, code generation, and test-case generation.
Why ? Swagger is a set of rules (in other words, a specification) for a format describing REST APIs. The format is both machine-readable and human-readable.</description>

      <guid>https://zupit.github.io/opensource-tech-radar/pt-br/categories/platforms/vcluster/</guid>
      <description>What is it ? Virtual clusters have their own API server which makes them much more powerful and better isolated than namespaces, but they are also much cheaper than creating separate &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; Kubernetes clusters.
Why ? Virtual clusters solve many of the problems that namespaces present, such as:
 Cluster-Scoped Resources: Certain resources live globally in the cluster, and you can’t isolate them using namespaces. For example, installing istio or any other operator in different versions is not possible within a single cluster.</description>

      <description>What is it ? C4 stands for context, containers, components, and code — a set of hierarchical diagrams that you can use to describe your software architecture at different zoom levels, each useful for different audiences.
Why ? The C4 model is a simple way to communicate software architecture at different levels of abstraction, so that you can tell different stories to different audiences. It&amp;rsquo;s also a way to introduce (often, reintroduce) some rigour and lightweight modelling to software development teams.</description>

      <guid>https://zupit.github.io/opensource-tech-radar/pt-br/categories/techniques/clean-architecture/</guid>
      <description>What is it ? Clean architecture is a software design philosophy that separates the elements of a design into ring levels. The main rule of clean architecture is that code dependencies can only move from the outer levels inward. Code on the inner layers can have no knowledge of functions on the outer layers.
Why ? Clean architecture is a way of structuring or separating your code so that what your app does, how your app do what it does and how your app display what he did, are separate and has no dependencies on each other.</description>

      <guid>https://zupit.github.io/opensource-tech-radar/pt-br/categories/techniques/ddd/</guid>
      <description>What is it ? Domain-driven design is the concept that the structure and language of software code should match the business domain. For example, if a software processes loan applications, it might have classes such as LoanApplication and Customer, and methods such as AcceptOffer and Withdraw.
Why ? Overall, DDD is worth learning because it simplifies one factor that is complex in every professional relationship: communication. DDD allows developers, domain experts, DBAs, business owners, and (most importantly) clients to communicate effectively with each other in order to solve problems.</description>

      <description>What is it ? gRPC is an open source remote procedure call system initially developed at Google in 2015 as the next generation of the RPC infrastructure Stubby.
Why ? gRPC uses HTTP/2 to support highly performant and scalable API&amp;rsquo;s and makes use of binary data rather than just text which makes the communication more compact and more efficient. gRPC makes better use of HTTP/2 then REST. gRPC for example makes it possible to turn-off message compression.</description>

      <guid>https://zupit.github.io/opensource-tech-radar/pt-br/categories/techniques/microservices/</guid>
      <description>What is it ? Microservice architecture – a variant of the service-oriented architecture structural style – arranges an application as a collection of loosely-coupled services. In a microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight.
Why ? With microservices, multiple teams work on independent services, enabling you to deploy more quickly — and pivot more easily when you need to. Development time is reduced, and your teams&amp;rsquo; code will be more reusable.</description>

      <description>What is it ? Objectives and key results is a goal-setting framework for defining and tracking objectives and their outcomes.
Why ? OKRs (objectives and key results) can help you achieve those goals—no matter what kind they are. Whether you are looking to improve your individual goals, your company goals, or are suggesting a new management tool to other leadership, OKRs will work. &amp;hellip; The OKR process helps turn good ideas into great execution.</description>

      <description>What is it ? The memo-style of presentation is designed—contra forms like PowerPoint—to make presenting new ideas difficult for the presenter but easier for their audience. &amp;hellip; At Amazon, the memo format allows every meeting where ideas are presented to turn into a deep debate of the idea&amp;rsquo;s relative costs and merits.
Why ? We currently use this style in all our open source projects. The objective is to have a clear and objective vision of what our projects are capable of, objectives, values and lessons learned in a summarized way.</description>

      <description>What is it ? Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the software is improved to pass the new tests, only.
Why ? TDD promotes a test-then-code approach. It’s based on the idea that if developers use test cases before writing functionality, they can create better software and, often, complete the project faster.</description>

      <description>What is it ? Chai is a BDD / TDD assertion library for node and the browser that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework.
Why ? Chai has several interfaces that allow the developer to choose the most comfortable. The chain-capable BDD styles provide an expressive language &amp;amp; readable style, while the TDD assert style provides a more classical feel.

      <description>What is it ? Code coverage is a measurement used to express which lines of code were executed by a test suite. We use three primary terms to describe each line executed.
Why ? Code coverage tools incentivize developers to write tests and increase coverage. During the process of writing tests, the developer may discover new bugs or syntax issues in the source code that are important to resolve before distributing the application.</description>

Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.
Why ? Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to.</description>
