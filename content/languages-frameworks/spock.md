# What is it ?
Spock is a Java testing framework capable of handling the full life cycle of a computer program. It was initially created in 2008 by Peter Niederwieser, a software engineer with GradleWare. A second Spock committer is Luke Daley who is also the creator of the popular Geb functional testing framework.

# Why ?

Spock is a testing and specification framework for Java and Groovy applications. What makes it stand out from the crowd is its beautiful and highly expressive specification language. Thanks to its JUnit runner, Spock is compatible with most IDEs, build tools, and continuous integration servers. Spock is inspired from JUnit, RSpec, jMock, Mockito, Groovy, Scala, Vulcans, and other fascinating life forms.
