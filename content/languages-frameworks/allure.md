# What is it ?

Allure Framework is a flexible lightweight multi-language test report tool that not only shows a very concise representation of what have been tested in a neat web report form, but allows everyone participating in the development process to extract maximum of useful information from everyday execution of tests.

# Why ?

Allure is an open-source framework designed to create interactive and comprehensive test report by Yandex QA Team. Each time when we run automation tests, we will have test results to view details about no. of tests passed, failed and failure details etc. And few reports also include test failure screenshots.
