# What is it ?

Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin's standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise. 


# Why ?

The most strongly supported JVM language in the Android ecosystem—aside from Java—is Kotlin, an open-source, statically typed language developed by JetBrains. JetBrains created one of the most popular IDEs, IntelliJ IDEA, as well as Android Studio, which Google crowned as the standard IDE for Android development.
