# What is it ?

TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. TypeScript is designed for the development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript.


# Why ?

* TypeScript simplifies JavaScript code, making it easier to read and debug.
* TypeScript is open source.
* TypeScript provides highly productive development tools for JavaScript IDEs and practices, like static checking.
* TypeScript makes code easier to read and understand.
* With TypeScript, we can make a huge improvement over plain JavaScript.
* TypeScript gives us all the benefits of ES6 (ECMAScript 6), plus more productivity.
* TypeScript can help us to avoid painful bugs that developers commonly run into when writing JavaScript by type checking the code.
* Powerful type system, including generics.
* TypeScript is nothing but JavaScript with some additional features.
* Structural, rather than nominal.
* TypeScript code can be compiled as per ES5 and ES6 standards to support the latest browser.
* Aligned with ECMAScript for compatibility.
* Starts and ends with JavaScript.
* Supports static typing.
* TypeScript will save developers time.
* TypeScript is a superset of ES3, ES5, and ES6.
