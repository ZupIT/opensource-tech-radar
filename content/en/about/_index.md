# What is Radar?
Tech Radar is like a portfolio to visualize the technologies and methodologies that an institution uses and trusts, monitor new trends and also identify which tools can be discontinued. Your goal is to keep teams strategically updated.

# How it works?
Radar has four quadrants, with their respective categories: languages and frameworks, platforms, techniques and services. In each of the quadrants there are four rings, where the level of importance and relevance of the technology and/or methodology is identified. Our rings are named Strategic, Essential, Potential and Discontinued. The closer the technology is to the center of the radar, the more important it is.

For example, to choose a tool, language or methodology, we will prioritize the one that the team already knows or masters. In some cases, it is important to check if there is any study regarding this new demand. If two teams need to know a tool, all engineering will know that there is a new front with this objective, thanks to Radar.
# Tech Radar within teams
Within the open source team at Zup, we use Tech Radar for knowledge management and also to help us make a quality solution.

Discover our main motivations:

Manage the information that circulates between different teams: knowing the tools each team uses or wants to use makes it easier to establish effective communication between projects and also avoid knowledge silos.

Motivate and train: once the technologies that teams need to learn and/or improve are mapped, it is possible to organize study groups, lectures, workshops and research, including cross-times.

Avoid losing focus and the "herd effect": even though there is plenty of opportunity to learn about new tools in external events, it is important to pay attention to the real motivations behind the pile used, as they will certainly have tools that "scale", " perform‚Äù, etc. Care must be taken not to turn the projects into a "laboratory in production".

Prevent the technology stack from becoming a "fruit salad": very similar to the previous case and, sometimes, derived from it, the big point is to avoid having several tools that do the same thing. After all, if within the group there is already a solution that solves a problem, what is the motivation to use a new one for the same purpose?

Code quality: a focused team with high cohesion in the technology stack facilitates knowledge management, resulting in good practices and fluency between teams, as well as better written and worked codes.

Being truly open source: one of the critical points in these types of projects is that they really need to be open source, that is, that their dependencies have licenses compatible with our projects.

# Our rings
Strategic: everything considered fundamental to the projects. The teams have knowledge, security and fluency.

Essential: everything that is already in the process of adoption, knowledge is vital to the team's success. Therefore, teams need training and/or experience.

Potential: everything that adheres to the culture, the necessary licenses and has the potential to be adopted in current projects or in future engagements. For this, it is interesting to carry out studies and tests to validate the effectiveness in the respective application scenario.

Discontinued: anything that is currently used but must be removed. The reasons for such a measure are due to the cohesion of the technological stack or the break in culture and/or open source licenses adopted.
