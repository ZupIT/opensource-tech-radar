# What is it ?

Virtual clusters have their own API server which makes them much more powerful and better isolated than namespaces, but they are also much cheaper than creating separate "real" Kubernetes clusters.

# Why ?

Virtual clusters solve many of the problems that namespaces present, such as:

* Cluster-Scoped Resources: Certain resources live globally in the cluster, and you canâ€™t isolate them using namespaces. For example, installing istio or any other operator in different versions is not possible within a single cluster.
* Shared Kubernetes control plane: the API server, etcd, scheduler, and controller-manager are shared in a single Kubernetes cluster. Request or storage rate-limiting based on a namespace is very hard and faulty configuration might bring down the whole cluster.
