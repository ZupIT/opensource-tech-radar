# Why ?

Keycloak offers everything a sophisticated user management tool needs â€“ without having to log on repeatedly with every login and into every system-as well as system security, social logins, support for mobile apps and integration into other solutions. Keycloak have implementations to LDAP and Active Directory as well.
