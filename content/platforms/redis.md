# What is it ?

Redis is an in-memory data structure store, used as a distributed, in-memory key–value database, cache and message broker, with optional durability. Redis supports different kinds of abstract data structures, such as strings, lists, maps, sets, sorted sets, HyperLogLogs, bitmaps, streams, and spatial indices.

# Why ?

Redis simplifies your code by enabling you to write fewer lines of code to store, access, and use data in your applications. For example, if your application has data stored in a hashmap, and you want to store that data in a data store – you can simply use the Redis hash data structure to store the data.
