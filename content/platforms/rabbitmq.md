# What is it ?

RabbitMQ is an open-source message-broker software that originally implemented the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol and has since been extended with a plug-in architecture to support Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol, MQ Telemetry Transport, and other protocols.

# Why ?

RabbitMQ is therefore ideal for long-running tasks or blocking tasks, allowing web servers to respond quickly to requests instead of being forced to perform computationally intensive tasks on the spot. RabbitMQ simply stores messages and passes them to consumers when ready.
