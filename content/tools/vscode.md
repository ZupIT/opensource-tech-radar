# What is it ?

Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.

# Why ?

Visual Studio Code combines the simplicity of a source code editor with powerful developer tooling, like IntelliSense code completion and debugging. ... The delightfully frictionless edit-build-debug cycle means less time fiddling with your environment, and more time executing on your ideas.
