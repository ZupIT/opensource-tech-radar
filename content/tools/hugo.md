# What is it ?
Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.

# Why ?

Hugo is for people who want to hand code their own website without worrying about setting up complicated runtimes, dependencies and databases. Hugo is for people building a blog, a company site, a portfolio site, documentation, a single landing page, or a website with thousands of pages.

Hugo is the default documentation page to all the open source projects, it includes the Tech Radar itself.
