# What is it ?
Chai is a BDD / TDD assertion library for node and the browser that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework.

# Why ?

Chai has several interfaces that allow the developer to choose the most comfortable. The chain-capable BDD styles provide an expressive language & readable style, while the TDD assert style provides a more classical feel.
