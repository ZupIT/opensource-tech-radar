# What is it ?
Code coverage is a measurement used to express which lines of code were executed by a test suite. We use three primary terms to describe each line executed.


# Why ?
Code coverage tools incentivize developers to write tests and increase coverage. During the process of writing tests, the developer may discover new bugs or syntax issues in the source code that are important to resolve before distributing the application.

Codecov takes coverage to the next level. Unlike open source and paid products, Codecov focuses on integration and promoting healthy pull requests. Codecov delivers or "injects" coverage metrics directly into the modern workflow to promote more code coverage, especially in pull requests where new features and bug fixes commonly occur.
