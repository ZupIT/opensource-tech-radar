# What is it ?

The Kubernetes command-line tool, kubectl, allows you to run commands against Kubernetes clusters. You can use kubectl to deploy applications, inspect and manage cluster resources, and view logs. For more information including a complete list of kubectl operations, see the kubectl reference documentation.

# Why ?

Kubectl is your cockpit to control Kubernetes. It allows you to perform every possible Kubernetes operation. From a technical point of view, kubectl is a client for the Kubernetes API. The Kubernetes API is an HTTP REST API. This API is the real Kubernetes user interface.
