# What is it ?

Clean architecture is a software design philosophy that separates the elements of a design into ring levels. The main rule of clean architecture is that code dependencies can only move from the outer levels inward. Code on the inner layers can have no knowledge of functions on the outer layers.

# Why ?

Clean architecture is a way of structuring or separating your code so that what your app does, how your app do what it does and how your app display what he did, are separate and has no dependencies on each other. Clean architecture gives you the following benefits: Maintainability (each layer maintains its code).
