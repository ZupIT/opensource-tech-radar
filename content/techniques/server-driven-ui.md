# What is it ?

Microservice architecture – a variant of the service-oriented architecture structural style – arranges an application as a collection of loosely-coupled services. In a microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight.

# Why ?

With microservices, multiple teams work on independent services, enabling you to deploy more quickly — and pivot more easily when you need to. Development time is reduced, and your teams' code will be more reusable. By decoupling services, you won't have to operate on expensive machines.
