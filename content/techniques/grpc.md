# What is it ?

gRPC is an open source remote procedure call system initially developed at Google in 2015 as the next generation of the RPC infrastructure Stubby.

# Why ?

gRPC uses HTTP/2 to support highly performant and scalable API's and makes use of binary data rather than just text which makes the communication more compact and more efficient. gRPC makes better use of HTTP/2 then REST. gRPC for example makes it possible to turn-off message compression.

# For who ?
