# What is it ?

Domain-driven design is the concept that the structure and language of software code should match the business domain. For example, if a software processes loan applications, it might have classes such as LoanApplication and Customer, and methods such as AcceptOffer and Withdraw.

# Why ?

Overall, DDD is worth learning because it simplifies one factor that is complex in every professional relationship: communication. DDD allows developers, domain experts, DBAs, business owners, and (most importantly) clients to communicate effectively with each other in order to solve problems.
