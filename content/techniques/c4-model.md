# What is it ?

C4 stands for context, containers, components, and code â€” a set of hierarchical diagrams that you can use to describe your software architecture at different zoom levels, each useful for different audiences.

# Why ?

The C4 model is a simple way to communicate software architecture at different levels of abstraction, so that you can tell different stories to different audiences. It's also a way to introduce (often, reintroduce) some rigour and lightweight modelling to software development teams.
