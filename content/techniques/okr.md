# What is it ?

Objectives and key results is a goal-setting framework for defining and tracking objectives and their outcomes. 

# Why ?

OKRs (objectives and key results) can help you achieve those goalsâ€”no matter what kind they are. Whether you are looking to improve your individual goals, your company goals, or are suggesting a new management tool to other leadership, OKRs will work. ... The OKR process helps turn good ideas into great execution.
