# What is it ?

The memo-style of presentation is designed—contra forms like PowerPoint—to make presenting new ideas difficult for the presenter but easier for their audience. ... At Amazon, the memo format allows every meeting where ideas are presented to turn into a deep debate of the idea's relative costs and merits.

# Why ?

We currently use this style in all our open source projects. The objective is to have a clear and objective vision of what our projects are capable of, objectives, values and lessons learned in a summarized way.
