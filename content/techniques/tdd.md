# What is it ?

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the software is improved to pass the new tests, only.

# Why ?

TDD promotes a test-then-code approach. Itâ€™s based on the idea that if developers use test cases before writing functionality, they can create better software and, often, complete the project faster. This approach is different from normal software testing, where they generate the code first and only then test it.

TDD developers use test cases before they write a single line of code. This approach encourages them to consider how the software will be used and what design it needs to have to provide the expected usability. Once a test fails, developers understand what needs to be changed and they refactor the code, that is, they rewrite it to improve it without altering its function.
